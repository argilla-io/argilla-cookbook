To gain eligibility for a Bachelors, you must have at least a GED and have scored well enough on the SAT. To be eligible for a Masters Degree, you must have completed a Bachelors degree program, and adequate scores on the GRE.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition, as a Bachelors degree student, your first year or two focuses on the acquisition of general knowledge and the last few years become more specialized, focusing primarily on classes for your major/minor area. \\\\n\\\\nIn contrast, the Master's degree program takes usually only 2 years to complete and the student is only focused on learning one speciality area during that time. In addition, a Masters program requires the student to be more of an independent learner, with classes requiring much more research and independent thought.\"}\n",
      "{'topic': 'computers & internet', 'question': 'Why do women get PMS?', 'answer': \"Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a group of symptoms related to the menstrual cycle. PMS is linked to changes in the endocrine system, which produces hormones that control the menstrual cycle. Medical experts don't fully understand the chain of events that causes premenstrual symptoms to be severe in some women and not in others. The one direct cause that is known to affect some women is genetic: Many women with PMS have a close family member with a history of PMS.\"}\n"
