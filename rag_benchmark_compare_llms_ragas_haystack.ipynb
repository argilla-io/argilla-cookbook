However, PCT levels were correlated with peak serum lactate levels immediately after graft reperfusion and elevation of serum aminotransferases on POD 1.

Specifically, these patients had higher International Normalized Ratio values on postoperative day 5 (p<0.05), indicating potential issues with blood clotting. They also had a higher incidence of primary graft non-function (p<0.05), which is a serious complication where the transplanted liver does not function properly. Additionally, these patients required a longer stay in the pediatric intensive care unit (p<0.01) and on mechanical ventilation (p=0.001), suggesting more severe postoperative complications. The study did not find a correlation between PCT elevation and systemic infection, but it did find a correlation between PCT levels and peak serum lactate levels immediately after graft reperfusion and elevation of serum aminotransferases on postoperative day 1, which are indicators of liver function and stress.\\n        \\n\\n        The answer is derived directly from the context, which states that patients with high PCT levels had worse outcomes, including higher INR values, primary graft non-function, and longer stays in critical care and on mechanical ventilation. These findings suggest that high PCT levels in the early phase after pediatric liver transplantation are indicative of a poorer postoperative outcome.\\n        \\n\\n')"

In this study we evaluated the pattern of adverse pathologic features in an identical cohort of African-American (AA) and Caucasian (CS) men with PCa. The overall cohort consisted of 1104 men (224 AA, and 880 CS) who underwent RP between 1990 and 2012. We compared preoperative factors and pathologic outcomes after RP across race groups. Multivariate analysis was used to identify factors predictive of adverse pathologic outcomes. The effect of race on adverse pathologic outcomes and biochemical control rate (BCR) was evaluated using multivariate regression model and Kaplan-Meier analysis. The 10-year BCR was 59% versus 82% in AA and CS men, respectively (P = .003). There was no significant difference in extraprostatic spread (P = .14), positive surgical margin (P = .81), lymph node involvement (P = .71), or adverse pathologic features (P = .16) across race groups. However, among patients with ≥ 1 adverse pathologic features, AA men had higher rate of seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) compared with CS men (51% vs. 30%; P = .01).

An experienced HS examiner retrospectively reanalyzed the HS data blinded to patient characteristics and pathologic results. The HS results for every single SV were compared with the corresponding findings from the final pathologic report after radical prostatectomy. An area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the prediction of SVI by HS was calculated. Depending on HS signal volume cut-offs (>0, >0.2, and >0.5 mL), the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for the prediction of SVI were assessed. Overall, 131 patients and 262 SVs were assessable. Of those, 23 (17.5%) men had SVI, and 39 (14.9%) single SVs were infiltrated by tumor overall. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for predicting SVI by HS was 0.54.

Including only men who met all National Comprehensive Cancer Network VLR criteria (clinical stage ≤T1, Gleason score ≤6, prostate-specific antigen [PSA] level <10 ng/mL, PSA density <0.15 ng/mL/cm(3), positive cores <3, percent cancer per core ≤50), we analyzed a cohort of 654 men (615 Caucasians and 39 AAs). The association of race with reclassification on serial biopsy was assessed with competing-risks regressions. AA men on AS were more likely than Caucasians to experience upgrading on serial biopsy (36% vs 16%; adjusted P <.001). Adjusting for PSA level, prostate size, volume of cancer on biopsy, treatment year, and body mass index, AA race was an independent predictor of biopsy reclassification (subdistribution hazard ratio, 1.8; P = .003).

However, among patients with ≥ 1 adverse pathologic features, AA men had higher rate of seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) compared with CS men. \\n         - Maybe, according to the study, after adjusting for known predictors of adverse pathologic features AA race remained a predictor of SVI. However, there was no significant difference in extraprostatic spread, positive surgical margin, lymph node involvement, or adverse pathologic features across race groups. \\n         - Yes, according to the study, AA men had higher rate of seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) compared with CS men. \\n         - No, according to the study, AA men had higher rate of seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) compared with CS men. \\n        Correct answer: 1\\n        Correct answer explanation: The study found that after adjusting for known predictors of adverse pathologic features, AA race remained a predictor of SVI. This suggests that African-American race is a predictor of seminal vesicle invasion after radical prostatectomy. \\n\\nNote: The other options are incorrect because they either contradict the study's findings or do not accurately summarize the study's results. Option 2 is incorrect because it states that there was no significant difference in SVI across race groups, which is not true. Option 3 is incorrect because it is ambiguous and does not accurately reflect the study's findings. Option 4 is incorrect because it states that AA men had a higher rate of SVI, but does not mention that AA race is a predictor of SVI after adjusting for known predictors. Option 5 is incorrect because it states that AA men had a higher rate of SVI, but then contradicts itself by saying that AA race is not a predictor of SVI. \\n\\nThis question requires the test-taker to carefully read and understand the study's findings, and to accurately summarize the results in their own words. It requires the test-taker to identify the correct answer based on the study's data and conclusions, rather than relying on general knowledge or assumptions. \\n\\nThe reasoning skill required for this question is Identifying Pros And Cons, as the test-taker needs to carefully evaluate the study's findings and identify the correct answer based on the\",\n",
       " 'retrieved_contexts': ['The purpose of the study was to determine whether racial differences exist in the pattern of local disease progression among men treated with radical prostatectomy (RP) for localized prostate cancer (PCa), which is currently unknown. In this study we evaluated the pattern of adverse pathologic features in an identical cohort of African-American (AA) and Caucasian (CS) men with PCa. The overall cohort consisted of 1104 men (224 AA, and 880 CS) who underwent RP between 1990 and 2012. We compared preoperative factors and pathologic outcomes after RP across race groups. Multivariate analysis was used to identify factors predictive of adverse pathologic outcomes. The effect of race on adverse pathologic outcomes and biochemical control rate (BCR) was evaluated using multivariate regression model and Kaplan-Meier analysis. The 10-year BCR was 59% versus 82% in AA and CS men, respectively (P = .003). There was no significant difference in extraprostatic spread (P = .14), positive surgical margin (P = .81), lymph node involvement (P = .71), or adverse pathologic features (P = .16) across race groups. However, among patients with ≥ 1 adverse pathologic features, AA men had higher rate of seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) compared with CS men (51% vs. 30%; P = .01). After adjusting for known predictors of adverse pathologic features AA race remained a predictor of SVI.',\n",
       "  'To examine the accuracy of HistoScanning (HS) in detecting seminal vesicle (SV) invasion (SVI) within prostate cancer (PCa) patients. We relied on our prospective institutional database. Patients who received HS before radical prostatectomy were included in the study cohort. An experienced HS examiner retrospectively reanalyzed the HS data blinded to patient characteristics and pathologic results. The HS results for every single SV were compared with the corresponding findings from the final pathologic report after radical prostatectomy. An area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the prediction of SVI by HS was calculated. Depending on HS signal volume cut-offs (>0, >0.2, and >0.5 mL), the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for the prediction of SVI were assessed. Overall, 131 patients and 262 SVs were assessable. Of those, 23 (17.5%) men had SVI, and 39 (14.9%) single SVs were infiltrated by tumor overall. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for predicting SVI by HS was 0.54. Depending on the HS signal volume cut-offs (>0, >0.2, and >0.5 mL), the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for predicting SVI were 76.9%, 10.8%, 13.1%, and 72.7%; 61.5%, 24.2%, 12.4%, and 78.3%; and 46.2%, 50.2%, 14.0%, and 84.2%, respectively.',\n",
       "  'To evaluate the risk of reclassification on serial biopsy for Caucasian and African American (AA) men with very low-risk (VLR) prostate cancer enrolled in a large prospective active surveillance (AS) registry. The Johns Hopkins AS registry is a prospective observational study that has enrolled 982 men since 1994. Including only men who met all National Comprehensive Cancer Network VLR criteria (clinical stage ≤T1, Gleason score ≤6, prostate-specific antigen [PSA] level <10 ng/mL, PSA density <0.15 ng/mL/cm(3), positive cores <3, percent cancer per core ≤50), we analyzed a cohort of 654 men (615 Caucasians and 39 AAs). The association of race with reclassification on serial biopsy was assessed with competing-risks regressions. AA men on AS were more likely than Caucasians to experience upgrading on serial biopsy (36% vs 16%; adjusted P <.001). Adjusting for PSA level, prostate size, volume of cancer on biopsy, treatment year, and body mass index, AA race was an independent predictor of biopsy reclassification (subdistribution hazard ratio, 1.8; P = .003). Examining specific modes of reclassification, AA race was independently associated with reclassification by grade (subdistribution hazard ratio, 3.0; P = .002) but not by volume.'],\n",
